# ezphp

ezphp is a really simple nearly single-file repository containing an MVC
implementation for PHP based projects.  To "install" it, just copy these files
into your web root.

## Setup

Copying these files to a directory and serving is the simplest way.

However, this ships with a CLI that will handle all of the basics such as:
- Creating a project directory
- Creating files for server compatibility with Nginx, Apache and PHP's built-in server

Creating a new project will involve editing config.yaml, routes.yaml and
packages.yaml.  Projects can also be generated from the command line, but if
exceeding three routes, it will be somewhat difficult to manage.
